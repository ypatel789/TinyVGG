# TinyVGG
Development of a convolutional neural network, based off the TinyVGG architecture, for image classification using the PyTorch framework. The project aimed to implement a compact and efficient model for identifying objects within images, showcasing the capabilities of PyTorch and deep learning techniques. See source code below as well as an interactive demonstration of the neural network.

See image_classification_model.ipynb (notebook) for full model and breakdown of all the steps taken to build, train, test and evaluate the model.

The model state_dict is also saved if you want to implement it in your own projects.
